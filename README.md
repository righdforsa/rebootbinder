Open source content for rebooting civilisation

I'm an expert at none of these things. However, with a will to bring the information together in the most carefully curated way, I believe I can provide a resource to the future, god-forbid if we ever need it. The initial section on survival is not a substitute for the many good prepping and survival books and blogs out there, but rather, the steps you have to have in place before you can even think about rebuilding a thriving civilisation.

Outline:

survival:
- shelter
- hygiene
- hunting/foraging
- agriculture
- preservation
- medicine

reboot:
- philosophy
- materials
- tools
- construction
- mechanics
- combustion
- electromagnetism
